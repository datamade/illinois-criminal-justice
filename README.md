Data extractions tools from Illinois state reports on the criminal justice system

This project extracts tabular data from the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts's [Annual Reports of the Illinois Courts](http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/SupremeCourt/AnnReport.asp) 
and from Illinois State Police's [Uniform Crime Reports](http://www.isp.state.il.us/crime/ucrhome.cfm).

This is pretty hairy now, but should get better documented soon.
